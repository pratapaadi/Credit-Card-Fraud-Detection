Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. We employ a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for classification and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The project is implemented in Python and utilizes various data analysis and machine learning libraries.

Introduction
Credit card fraud detection is crucial for financial institutions to minimize losses and enhance security. This project leverages machine learning to identify potentially fraudulent transactions. By utilizing PCA, we reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, improving the efficiency and performance of our SVC model.
Features
Dimensionality Reduction: PCA is used to reduce the feature space, making the model training process faster and more efficient.
Support Vector Classifier: An SVC model is trained to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
Data Visualization: Visualizations to understand data distributions and the impact of PCA.
Model Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
